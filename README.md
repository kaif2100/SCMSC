 Simulation of controlled motion of a spacecraft

I have been studying dynamic of spaceflight and I had to do some tasks which can be useful to some people (in my opinion), so I have decided to publish them.

Tasks are contained int **Tasks.docx** (Russian and English version). They are divided in few blocks as well as solutions.
The most interesting problems in each block is number three.
My solutions can be not very accurate and optimized, but they have to give proper results.
