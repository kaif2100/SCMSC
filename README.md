 Simulation of controlled motion of a spacecraft

I have been studying dynamic of spaceflight, with having some tasks to do, which can be useful to some people (in my opinion), so I have decided to publish them.

Tasks are contained in **Tasks.docx** (Russian and English version). They are divided in few blocks as well as solutions.
My solutions can be not very accurate and optimized, but they have to give proper results.

P.S. notebooks content some images and formulas, it may be not properly displayed in git, so you can try to download it and open on your own machine.
